          Completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology, one of the most prestigious institutions in Iran. My coursework provided a strong foundation in algorithms, systems, and AI. For my thesis, I developed a Paraphrasing Model for Persian Sentences, which introduced me to natural language processing and deep learning techniques. During my studies, I consistently improved my <mark>problem-solving</mark> skills and <mark>adaptability</mark>, preparing me for advanced research in AI.

        title: Facial Animation Retargeting
        # link: github.com/sproogen
        # link_text: Project Website
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project introduces a pipeline for facial animation retargeting that combines <mark>unsupervised</mark> expression transfer with 3D blendshape prediction, enabling the geometric reconstruction of facial expressions from 2D images. By bridging 2D reenactment with 3D parametric models, this work offers a modular framework for animation workflows, eliminating the need for paired training data or manual blendshape annotation. The results highlight its potential for applications in virtual avatars, AR/VR, and automated animation pipelines.
