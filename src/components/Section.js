            Welcome to my website! I'm Ali Ghasemi, a recent graduate of the BSc
            in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology. With a
            strong academic background and practical experience as a Front-end
            Developer, I am passionate about leveraging technology to create
            intuitive and impactful digital experiences.

            As a Front-end Developer, I have had the opportunity to apply my
            skills in creating user-friendly and visually appealing web
            applications. Through hands-on experience with tools like React.js,
            I have honed my ability to translate design concepts into functional
            and engaging interfaces.
            <br />
            <br />
            Passion and dedication drive me in my work. I thrive on pushing
            boundaries, constantly seeking innovative solutions to enhance user
            experiences and deliver exceptional results. With a strong work
            ethic and attention to detail, I strive for excellence in every
            project I undertake.
            <br />
            <br />
